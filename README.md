# Password Generator

## Description
This is a simple Python script that generates a random password of a user-specified length. The password can include special characters if the user chooses to include them.

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the desired length of the password.
3. When asked if you want to include special characters, type 'yes' or 'no'.
4. The script will then generate and print a random password of the specified length.
5. To generate another password, press enter. To exit the program, type 'quit'.(or enter, enter.)

## Code
The script uses the `string` and `random` modules in Python. It defines a function `generate_password(length, use_special_chars)` that generates a random password. The `while` loop in the script keeps the program running until the user decides to stop.(To allow the user to read the generated password.)
